description: The story of an Irishman who becomes the town hero after he boasts of
  murdering his father. The local are more interested in enjoying hist story than
  condemning his murderous deed. The Playboy of the Western World, was first performed
  in the Abbey on 26 January 1907. The comedy attracted a hostile reaction from the
  Irish public and thereafter a riot ensued. Described as "an unmitigated, protracted
  libel upon Irish peasant men, and worse still upon Irish girlhood".
